            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <h3>Why is accessibility in web design important?</h3>
             <p>The simple and more obvious answer to that question would be that, just like in everyday life, accessibility is a fundamental right. People shouldn’t be excluded from using a service because of their condition or a disability; moreover, accessibility is concerning more than just an individual; as said on the W3C website, “Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society” (Shawn Lawton Henry). While the web is offering an incredible number of opportunities and can be used to help and assist people with disabilities, it can become impossible to use if accessibility isn’t taken into account by the developers.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest bias we can have about disability would be that it is a physical one. It is, after all, the most common and visible representation we have from it; isn’t the logo on disable parking spots space a person in a wheelchair? However, we should take consideration in the fact than not only there is a lot of different physical and mental disabilities, but that we can all one day being disable, even if it is for a limited time such as having a broken wrist or breaking up our glasses and having to wait to get new ones. Oyetoke Tobi Emmanuel mentions in his article Why Web Accessibility Is Important and How You Can Accomplish It that “there are three Modes of Disability:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Permanent Disability: This is when you are completely disabled. Example: blind, deaf and so.</li>
                <li>Temporary Disability: This is simply a physical or mental disability which hinders your discharging of responsibilities for a short period of time.</li>
                <li>Conditional or Situation Disability: This is simply when you are not able to do things due to the situation you find yourself in. Example: slow internet connection.”</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Furthermore, in 2018, “1/5 of the population of the Earth [had] a disability and [struggled] to have access to the same services and products as people without disabilities have” (Andreea Popescu). What if this 1 out of 5 person was you? Or a family member such as your parent or kid? My own brother has autism and mental disabilities, and I worked many years with kids with special needs; therefore, I know how helpful the web can be or how hard it can be to access sometimes.</p>
            <p>The Web is a resource more and more used, and that is becoming essential nowadays with the pandemic we are living and people working or studying from home. Whether it is for your job or school, to contact your family and friends, to buy something, to entertain yourself or to have a Zoom call with your healthcare provider, you are using the Web and Internet. Those services I just cited should be available for everyone as the article Introduction to Web Accessibility says, “It is important that the Web be accessible to everyone in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities. An accessible Web can help people with disabilities participate more actively in society” (Shawn Lawton Henry). Therefore, as I mentioned earlier, Web accessibility is important not only from an individual perspective as it improves the life of people with disabilities and includes them, but it is also giving them the possibilities to use businesses and to contribute to society. Moreover, as a web designer, wouldn’t you like your work to be available to as many persons as possible? As mentioned in the W3C website, “Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.” (Shawn Lawton Henry).</p>
            <p>Finally, if you are still not convinced of the importance of web accessibility, know that in some cases, it is required by laws and policies: you can find on the W3C website a list of the different “governmental policies related to web accessibility” (Mary Jo Mueller and al.).</p>
